BEGIN_PGML
There is a unit of temperature called Kelvin that is often used in physics.  The conversion from Fahrenheit to Kelvin can be written as a line.  If [`32^{\circ}`]F is [`273.15^{\circ}`]K and [`212^{\circ}`]F is [`373.15^{\circ}`]K.  Find the conversion from degrees F to degrees K.  (The answer should be written in terms of K.) 

F=[_]{$g}{20}.
